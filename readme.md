# Algorithms and Data Structure Nanodegree
 This repo contains all projects implemented as part of the Algorithms and Data Structure Nanodegree. Each folder corresponds to a module's project and contains implementation of various problem along with implementation explanation and analysis.

 ## Projects:
 - Investigating Texts and Calls
 - Show me the data structures:
 Showcases implementation of famous data sturctures including LRU Cache, Huffman Encoding, Union-Intersection, blockchain and searching for files using file recursion
 - Problems Vs. Algorithms
 Showcases using famous algorithms to solve various problems including solving for Sqrt, searching in a rotated list, forming sum of maximum numbers from a list of digtits, getting minimum and maximum from an array and finally using tries in Autocompletion and HTTP Routing
